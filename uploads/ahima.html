<h4>Preamble</h4>
<p>The ethical obligations of the health information management (HIM) professional include the safeguarding of privacy and security of health information; disclosure of health information; development, use, and maintenance of health information systems and health information; and ensuring the accessibility and integrity of health information.</p>
<p>Healthcare consumers are increasingly concerned about security and the potential loss of privacy and the inability to control how their personal health information is used and disclosed. Core health information issues include what information should be collected; how the information should be handled, who should have access to the information, under what conditions the information should be disclosed, how the information is retained and when it is no longer needed, and how is it disposed of in a confidential manner. All of the core health information issues are performed in compliance with state and federal regulations, and employer policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Ethical obligations are central to the professional's responsibility, regardless of the employment site or the method of collection, storage, and security of health information.  In addition, sensitive information (e.g., genetic, adoption, drug,alcohol, sexual, health, and behavioral information) requires special attention to prevent misuse.  In the world of business and interactions with consumers, expertise in the protection of the information is required.</p>
<h4>Purpose of the American Health Information Management Association Code of Ethics</h4>
<p>The HIM professional has an obligation to demonstrate actions that reflect values, ethical principles, and ethical guidelines.The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) Code of Ethics sets forth these values and principles to guide conduct.  (See also <a href="http://www.ahima.org/about/mission.aspx" target="_blank">AHIMA Vision, Mission, Values</a>) The code is relevant to all AHIMA members and CCHIIM credentialed HIM professionals [hereafter referred to as certificants], regardless of their professional functions, the settings in which they work, or the populations they serve. These purposes strengthen the HIM professional's efforts to improve overall quality of healthcare.</p>

The AHIMA Code of Ethics serves seven purposes:
<ul>
<li>Promotes high standards of HIM practice.</li>
<li>Identifies core values on which the HIM mission is based.</li>
<li>Summarizes broad ethical principles that reflect the profession's core values.</li>
<li>Establishes a set of ethical principles to be used to guide decision-making and actions.</li>
<li>Establishes a framework for professional behavior and responsibilities when professional obligations conflict or ethical uncertainties arise.</li>
<li>Provides ethical principles by which the general public can hold the HIM professional accountable.</li>
<li>Mentors practitioners new to the field to HIM's mission, values, and ethical principles.</li>
</ul>

The code includes principles and guidelines that are both enforceable and aspirational. The extent to which each principle is enforceable is a matter of professional judgment to be exercised by those responsible for reviewing alleged violations of ethical principles.

<h4>The Code of Ethics and How to Interpret the Code of Ethics</h4>
<h5>Principles and Guidelines</h5>
<p>The following ethical principles are based on the core values of the American Health Information Management Association and apply to all AHIMA members and certificants.  Guidelines included for each ethical principle are a non-inclusive list of behaviors and situations that can help to clarify the principle. They are not meant to be a comprehensive list of all situations that can occur.</p>

<h4>The Use of the Code</h4>
<p>Violation of principles in this code does not automatically imply legal liability or violation of the law. Such determination can only be made in the context of legal and judicial proceedings. Alleged violations of the code would be subject to a peer review process. Such processes are generally separate from legal or administrative procedures and insulated from legal review or proceedings to allow the profession to counsel and discipline its own members although in some situations,violations of the code would constitute unlawful conduct subject to legal process.</p>

<p>Guidelines for ethical and unethical behavior are provided in this code. The terms &quot;shall and shall not&quot; are used as a basis for setting high standards for behavior. This does not imply that everyone &quot;shall or shall not&quot; do everything that is listed. This concept is true for the entire code. If someone does the stated activities, ethical behavior is the standard. The guidelines are not a comprehensive list. For example, the statement &quot;safeguard all confidential patient information to include, but not limited to, personal, health, financial, genetic and outcome information&quot; can also be interpreted as &quot;shall not fail to safeguard all confidential patient information to include personal, health, financial, genetic, and outcome information.&quot;</p>

<p>A code of ethics cannot guarantee ethical behavior. Moreover, a code of ethics cannot resolve all ethical issues or disputes or capture the richness and complexity involved in striving to make responsible choices within a moral community. Rather, a code of ethics sets forth values and ethical principles, and offers ethical guidelines to which a HIM professional can aspire and by which actions can be judged. Ethical behaviors result from a personal commitment to engage in ethical practice.</p>

<p>Professional responsibilities often require an individual to move beyond personal values. For example, an individual might demonstrate behaviors that are based on the values of honesty, providing service to others, or demonstrating loyalty. In addition to these, professional values might require promoting confidentiality, facilitating interdisciplinary colaboration, and refusing to participate or conceal unethical practices. Professional values could require a more comprehensive set of values than what an individual needs to be an ethical agent in one's own personal life.</p>

<p>The AHIMA Code of Ethics is to be used by AHIMA members and certificants, consumers, agencies, organizations, and bodies (such as licensing and regulatory boards, insurance providers, courts of law, government agencies, and other professional groups) that choose to adopt it or use it as a frame of reference. The AHIMA Code of Ethics reflects the commitment of all to uphold the profession's values and to act ethically. Individuals of good character who discern moral questions and, in good faith, seek to make reliable ethical judgments, must apply ethical principles.</p>

<p>The code does not provide a set of rules that prescribe how to act in all situations. Specific applications of the code must take into account the context in which it is being considered and the possibility of conflicts among the code's values,principles, and guidelines. Ethical responsibilities flow from all human relationships, from the personal and familial to the social and professional. Further, the AHIMA Code of Ethics does not specify which values, principles, and guidelines are the most important and ought to outweigh others in instances when they conflict.</p>
