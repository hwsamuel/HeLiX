<h4>Introduction </h4>
<p>As a professional body the British Computer Society (known as BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT), has a responsibility to set rules and professional standards to direct the behaviour of its members in professional matters. It is expected that these rules and professional standards will be higher than those established by the general law and that they will be enforced through disciplinary action which can result in expulsion from membership.</p>
<p>Members are expected to exercise their own judgement (which should be made in such a way as to be reasonably justified) to meet the requirements of the code and seek advice if in doubt.</p>
<p>Appendix 1 to the code sets examples of interpretation of the tenets of professional conduct and form part of this Code of Conduct. </p>

<h4>Breaches of the Code of Conduct </h4>
<p>If a member of BCS should know of, or become aware of, any breach of this Code of Conduct by another member they are under an obligation to notify BCS. </p>
<p>Breaches of the Code of Conduct may also be brought to the attention of BCS by others who are not members of BCS. 
Any breach of the Code of Conduct brought to the attention of BCS, or of which BCS becomes aware, will be considered under the Institute's Disciplinary procedures.</p> 
<p>Where BCS receives information that a member has been convicted of a criminal offence, the member, when asked will provide a Standard Disclosure Certificate or other similar notice providing evidence of their criminal record (if any) within 28 days. Note that not all convictions are seen as relevant to membership in BCS and each case will be considered individually. </p>
